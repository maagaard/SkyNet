## Project info

### Language
- Java 8

### Project work outline
- Start thinking about how to do this...
- Simple Single Agent
- Decenteralized vs centralized
- Handling different color of boxes and agents
- Heuristics (with multiple boxes and goals of same kind)
- Set partial goals, benchmark (nodes, memory, explored etc)
- Fullfill benchmarking levels


### Code
- stdin/stdout reader/writer
- Use names from lecture in codes as classifiers

### Project structure outline
- Single agent structure
- Communication between agents 
- Plan sharing
- Conflict handling



### Class proposals
- Level
- Planner
- Plan (strategy?)
- Agent
- Heuristic
- Command


### Other stuff
- Level
    - Walls - rigid
    - Goals - rigid
    - Agents (co-ordinate based?)
    - Boxes (co-ordinate based?)

- Plan
    - State change steps (boxes and agents)
