# AI - Assignment 3

## Language: 
- Java

## TODO:
- Start thinking about how to do this...
- Simple Single Agent
- Decenteralized vs centralized
- Handling different color of boxes and agents
- Heuristics (with multiple boxes and goals of same kind)
- Set partial goals, benchmark (nodes, memory, explored etc)
- Fullfill benchmarking levels

## Planner:
- Goals
- Priorities
- Plan
- Map(.lvl) input --> plan output (sequence of action)
- Fully observable and deterministic environment
- Types of planners: POP


### 1st iteration:
- Single agent handling

### 2nd iteration:
- Multi agent handling

## Code:
- stdin/stdout reader/writer
- Use names from lecture in codes as classifiers

## Project structure outline:
- Single agent structure
- Communication between agents 
- Plan sharing
- Conflict handling
